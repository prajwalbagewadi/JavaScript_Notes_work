            In web applications, a session refers to a temporary state maintained between the server and the client (typically a web browser) during a user's interaction with the app. Here are some key points about sessions:
            User Context: Sessions help maintain user context as they navigate through different pages. For example, when a user logs in, their session can store information like their user ID or authentication status.
            
            Session Storage: Data can be stored in different ways, such as:

            Cookies: Small pieces of data stored in the user's browser. They can persist between sessions but have size limits.
            Session Storage: A type of web storage that allows storage of data for the duration of a page session. Data is lost when the tab or browser is closed.


            Using sessionStorage
            Use the window.sessionStorage property of the window object to gain access to the sessionStorage.

            You may easily access the sessionStorage using the following syntax because the window is the global object:

            window.sessionStorage  
            OR
            sessionStorage  
            
            setItem(): it works to set the information for the session storage element.

            sessionStorage.setItem('uname',name)
            sessionStorage.setItem('pass',pass)
